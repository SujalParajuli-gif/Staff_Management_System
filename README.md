# Staff Management System

This is a Java-based academic staff management system built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Developed in **BlueJ**, the program models `Teacher`, `Lecturer`, and `Tutor` classes using inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding. It supports grading logic, salary calculation, and object management via console-based outputs.
